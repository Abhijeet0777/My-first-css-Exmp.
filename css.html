<h2>by-ABHIJEET JHA</h2>
<p>Thanks for giving me an opportunity to introduce myself to you, ma’am. I am Abhijeet kumar jha and I put up in Darbhanga with my family—my mother and father. Currently , I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Lovely professional unversity. I have recently appeared for the CCNA certification examination and I am awaiting the result. Since my school days, I have been quite passionate about computers and networks and always wanted to work on live switches. Talking about my hobbies and interests, I love playing Cricket and I was the sports captain in my school. We have won quite a lot of inter-school and inter-state tournaments in Cricket and have brought laurels to the school..</p>
